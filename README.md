    1.Create folder named "LogLibrary" and another folder in it named "Program files".
    In "Program files" you must put 2 files: "phone numbers.txt" 
    (DON'T ERASE THE 1ST LINE IN THE FILE!!!!) from this repository, and "pass.txt".
    
    2.Copy the way to "program files" folder, open .py file in notepad, erase and paste

    basepath = r"C:\Users\user\Documents\LogLibrary\Program files"
